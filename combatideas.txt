Combat example first stats 42% attacker 39% oppen

Attacker runs up smacks mob, he clearly gets a critical strike
now the critical strike drops 5%, he used it.

37% vs 39% now
round 2, yeah now the mob dodges, or blocks, he loses 5% for
a dodge, 3% for a block, lets say he just dodged. (-1 dogde 4 left for round)


37% vs 34% now

Again attacker has the advantage, and it continues until 
all blocks or dodges or attacks are used.

buffs for stats will be factored in, extra spells/item bonuses
etc can be factored in.

Next round we begin again. 


Yeah needs some work, but i think it is a solid idea.
