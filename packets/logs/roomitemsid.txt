Doors have a game id
they lead to specific places.
These are probably going to have to be static
and removed from use by players like roomnumbers


Backpacks and chests.
Cant put containers with items, in items, well we could
but it would be confusing.

Backpacks will have a sqlid, this wont change, and a ownersqlid which can by trading
change, 
Chests will have a sqlid and a sqlownerid that should never change,
only the id's of the items in the chest.
items in chest should be owned by the chest sqlid ? the chest sql owned by player - yes
has to be, or all items will try and load into inventory.

Rooms need to save items too, bedrooms do, those should not disappear on relog.
These items are chairs, beds, animation, chests, doors and any other game item.

So, should any item dropped into a room have a destroy timer ? besides house.
then all items always stay unless the destory timer tick is told to start ?
